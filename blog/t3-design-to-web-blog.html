          <li>What is a responsive site, and why is responsiveness important?</li>
            <p>
              Responsiveness is a web page's ability to adjust based on the size of the screen. This is important because more and more, people are accessing web pages through different and multiple devices - phones, tablets, laptops, and PCs, all of which have varying sized screens. As a developer, you want to make sure your content looks good no matter which screen the user is using to view your page.
          <li>What is mobile-first design, and why is it important?</li>
            <p>
              The majority of people access the internet through their phones, so it only makes sense that a developer should be designing web pages to first and foremost accommodate mobile. From there, you can make adjustments to the code to look good when the screen gets bigger. Mobile-first design is important for a few reasons: First, it encourages the designers/developers to actually have mobile in mind (since we're likely working on laptops and larger screens, it's easy to design for the large screen even though the user is more likely to view your product on a small screen). Second, it's easier to design from small to big instead of big to small. It's easier for a UI designer to expand upon the content of a mobile screen onto a larger screen than to take all the content that is possible to display on a large screen and condense it to a mobile view. Thinking mobile first makes responsive desigining easier.

          <li> What are frameworks, and what are their pros and cons?</li>
            <p>
              Frameworks are pre-designed foundations for a dev to build upon. They lay the ground work for your HTML and CSS so that you have an already-built starting point, upon which you add your customization.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pros to frameworks is that it can save you a lot of time and energy because a lot of ground work is completed for you, in terms of defining the grid of the page as well as stylistic elements like what buttons look like, hyperlinks, fonts, colours, etc. The downside is that you must work within the constraints of the framework. You should also know the framework well, so that if things are't looking like you want them to, you can understand what elements of the framework CSS is causing that effect and what you can d in your customization to override that styling element. I also found a con to using a framework was that you need to use their class language (ie, "four columns" instead of "four-columns" or "four.columns") or else the pre-prepared styling won't take effect.

          <li>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</li>
            <p>
              A wireframe is a quick sketch that provides a basic design outline. It is useful to convey information across team members, as well as to help with brainstorming, because it communicates visual information without being resource intensive. Wireframes are usually black-and-white, can be done by hand or on the computer, and are composed of simple lines and boxes to denote graphic information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below are the wireframes that were created for this website:
            </p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="four columns">
                <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="Desktop Blog Page Wireframe" />
              </div>
              <div class="four columns">
                <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" />
              </div>
              <div class="four columns">
                <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" />
              </div>
              <div class="four columns">
                <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" />
              </div>
            </div>
          <li>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</li>
            <p>
              <ul class="sub">
                <li class="sub">I had difficulty implementing the mixed-sized grid. I wanted the boxes to vary in size whie still lining up together, but I couldn't figure out how to make a box line up at the half-way point of another box. So, I decided to create a simple grid and would complicate it when I understood it better.</li>
                <li class="sub">I had difficulty understanding the grid system of skeleton. My images aren't really aligning well within the grid; they seem to be justified left inside the column instead of centered. There were many times when I would play with corrections that seemed like they should work but they didn't.</li>
                <li class="sub">My website is not appearing responsive on my end. Someone in Slack says that it is behaving responsively on their screen, but I don't know why I can't see the boxes realign when I preview on mobile.</li>
                <li class="sub">Spacing is tough. It's easy to include spacing that looks good on your particular screen, but making it so that margins and paddings look right responsively is tricky.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
        </ul>
