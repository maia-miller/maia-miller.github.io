          <li>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</li>
            <p>
              I've learned 'mindfulness conversation' previously as 'active listening' - not interrupting, saying "What I hear you saying is", etc. I enjoy listening in this way, and using these techniques are a good reminder of how to improve your own listening. It's easy to fall into the traps of cutting people off/trying to finish their sentences, being overeager to say your piece, assuming what another person is saying. These techniques are good reminders of how to be better at listening, and in turn, be a better communicator. I find these techniques satisfying because it makes me feel like I am doing a better job of engaging in a conversation. As a listener, it makes it easier to make sure your ideas are actually hear. It's not a struggle to nudge your ideas into their ideas - instead, you're given the space by the listener to fully explain yourself and make sure you were understood accurately.
            </p>
          <li>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</li>
          <p>
            I'm not sure. I don't know how I envision myself incorporating the learnings from this book into my life yet.
