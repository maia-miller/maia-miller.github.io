          <li> What is grid based design?</li>
            <p>
              Grid-based design is sort of like boxes on websites, in that it's ubiquitous and foundational to all websites. Grid based design is a way to organize the information on a page to follow the way that we naturally read a page - left to right, and top to bottom.

          <li> Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</li>
            <p>
              Responsive webpages are really important to make sure that your page can be read on every type of screen. Since today people are browsing the internet on all sorts of devices with all sorts of screen sizes (from gigantic monitors to tiny cellphones), it's important that a developer makes their work look good and readable on all screen sizes.
            </p>
          <li> What is semantic structure?</li>
            <p>
              These are the tags that can be easily read by scanning the code. It includes tags like headings, img, links (a href), etc. They're semantic structure because they're more part of our everyday language.

              <li class="sub">I don't understand what CSS resetting/normalizing is</li>
              <li class="sub">I found the whole breaking the page up into 12 columns really confusing. I feel like I hadn't seen it before, so it was difficult for me to wrap my head around it. It's not that column 1 is necessarily the first column of 12 to appear, it's a column that's only supposed to take up 8.33%. I need to spend more time understanding how this concept is applied</li>
              <li class="sub">Learning about media queries was really interesting and useful. It didn't work in my CSS though - and I'm too tired to problem solve it a whole bunch right now! - so it's something that I'll come back to.
