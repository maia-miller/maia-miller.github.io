          <li>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</li>
            <p>
              Self-awareness = "knowing one's internal states, preferences, resources and intuitions". Self-awareness maps onto areas of thinking that have to do with self-focused attention - similar to mindfulness. Both are about understanding the self, looking inward honestly and without judgement.
            </p>
          <li>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</li>
            <p>
              I liked the bringing up of a positive emotion for the Body Scan. It can be relatively easy to identify how your body is reacting when you're experiencing a negative emotion because of the way that those feelings an become all-encompassing. But I've never noticed how positive emotions influence my body. I find a general relaxation in my shoulders and inside my body, too.
            </p>
          <li>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</li>
            <p>
              Emotions are states of experience, which come and go and do not define us as a person.
