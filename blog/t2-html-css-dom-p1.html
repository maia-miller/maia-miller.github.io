          <li>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</li>
            <p>
              HTML, CSS and the DOM can be understood like building a house. The <b>HTML</b> is the structure of the house - the layout of the space, where the rooms will be, etc. <b>CSS</b> then styles the house - what colour are the walls? Is there carpeting or hardwood? What colour is that flooring? Finally, <b>The DOM</b> is your architect, the person who you can talk to to test out different ways of building your house. The HTML and CSS designate what your house/page will look like. But if you want to play with the wall colours, you can talk to the DOM (your architect) and ask to see what your house/page would look like if you changed the wall colour. The DOM is the interpreter of the HTML and CSS code, and gives you an area to play with the code without making any actual channges.

          <li>What is meant by boxifying design?</li>
            <p>
              All web pages, whether they look like it or not, are made up of boxes. "Boxifying" a design means to reinterpret a design according to boxes on the page.
            </p>
          <li>What is the box model?</li>
            <p>
              The box model is how all of those boxes that create a page are laid out. Every box on a page is composed of (in order from outside in): margin, border, padding, content. You can define each of those elements (include as 0), which will impact how that box looks or takes up space on a page.
