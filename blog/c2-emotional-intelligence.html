  <h1>Blog 5 - Reflection on Emotional Intelligence</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</li>
    <ul class="sub">
      <li class="sub">5 domains of emotional intelligence: (1) Self-awareness; (2) Self-regulation; (3) Motivation; (4) Empathy; (5) Social Skills</li>
      <li class="sub">(1)-(3)= intrapersonal; (4)-(5)= interpersonal</li>
      <li class="sub">Top 6 competencies that distinguish tech sector performers, majority of which are EQ: (1) Achievement drive and standard; (2) Ability to influence; (3) Conceptual thinking; (4) Analytic ability; (5) Initiative; (6) Self-confience </li>
      <li class="sub">Attention is a key foundation to emotional intelligence</li>
      <li class="sub"><i>Mindfulness</i>= paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally</li>
      <li class="sub"><i>Affect labeling</i> (=labeling a feeling) helps you manage that emotion</li>
      <li class="sub">Focusing an emotion to the body enables <i>high-resolution perception</i>= you can watch the subtle changes of the emotion as it waxes, wanes, and ceases</li>
    </ul>
    <li>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</li>
    <p>
      I'm not much into meditation. I decided to try it, but I think I prefer to find mindfulness in ways other than just sitting and focusing on my breathing: going on walks, for example, is a really enjoyable way for me to spend time with myself and introspect.
