          <li>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</li>
          <p>
            I studied a bit of UX design so I've learned how to use wireframes before and find them very useful. I enjoy using wireframes because they encourage me to focus on the process and the fundamentals of a site instead of getting distracted by the more aesthetic, pretty elements. My original concept was to have a collage of images on the homescreen, but I found that difficult to create. Focusing on the process - on the squares that make up a site - instead of the final product was helful in creating a more simple design first that hopefully I can upgrade to be more complex as I continue.

          <li>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</li>
          <p>
            Meditatioin makes me roll my eyes... I know a lot of people who do it, and so many who absolutely swear by it. It just seems boring and uninteresting to me. Deep attention and preoccupation is really enjoyable to me; empty-mindedness seems really dull.

          <li>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</li>
            <ul class="sub">
              <li class="sub">Meeta-attention is like riding a bike, where you make several small corrections to stay centred</li>
              <li class="sub">Agitating the mind is like agiating a pot of water with sediment. Once you begin to calm the water, calm and clarity manifest</li>
              <li class="sub">Physcal exercise enhances physical ability; mental exercise enhances mental ability like focus and perception</li>
              <li class="sub">Process: intention - breath - distraction - regain attentional focu</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</li>
            <ul class="sub">
              <li class="sub">If you have to react (for example, you really have to scratch), try to take five breaths before reacting. The reason to do this is to practice creating space between stimulus and reaction. The more we are able to create space between stimulus and reaction, the more control we will have over our emotional lives.</li>
