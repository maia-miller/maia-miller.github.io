<li>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</li>
I tried the Timebox technique, where I set up an hour to review the info that was provided (although I went past that hour to finish all the videos). I also implemented the idea of celebrating your accomplishments (I like a silent, "Yay!" with my arms raised in triumph).

<li>what did you find interesting?</li>
Some of the habits-forming techniques I've heard of before like pomodoro technique and breaking down tasks into smaller pieces. What I found interesting was how systematic human behaviour can really be. These kinds of systems work really well for people who like to be analytical and break down concepts into pieces - for example, recognizing the intrinsic and extrinsic rewards that work for you and how to implement them in your life, or how to break down a larger task like weight lose into the smaller pieces that make that goal achievable. That being said, there's a balance between programming human behaviour with triggers and practice, and honouring our natural rhythms and cycles like one of the last articles explained.

<li>what worked for you?</li>
Celebrations definintely work for me - taking time to recognize effort goes a long way for me in validating that effort. It makes the to-do list feel less daunting because I know that no matter what I accomplish, I'm a superstar for doing it ;) The pomodoro technique was also good for me, with some variation - I have more concentration in the mornings than afternoons, so I would give myself longer focus blocks in the first half of the day, or not at all and just use the technique for afternoons when I have more difficulty focusing.

<li>which will you experiment further with?</li>
I liked many of the ideas conveyed from Fogg and from the "Seven Counterinuitive Ways...". I want to try implementing <b>tiny new habits after already-developed habits</b> - and then <b>celebrate</b> them. I also want to <b>"aim to get nothing done"</b>, which again makes you feel accomplished when you do complete tasks. I also definitely want to try <b>giving myself less time</b> - I know that I often procrastinate because I <i>know</i> I have enough time, often too much time. But it just means I spend a lot of time sitting around bored, avoiding doing things, and in turn not doing anything fun. If I limit how much time I let myself do a task I need to do, then not only does it force me to get that task completed, it opens up the rest of my time to do hobbies and other fun things! I think that technique will go a long way for me.
