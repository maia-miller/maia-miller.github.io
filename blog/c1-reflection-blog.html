  <h1>Blog 1 - Reflection</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience? What are your impressions?</li>
    <p>
    The DBC/EDA experience strikes me as a heavily collaborative and creative experience. Shefeer's analogy to a restaurant was really helpful; seeing this course as something to be a part of rather than something to consume impacts the whole mindset of how to approach the learnings of this program. while there is a curriculumn in place, where those teachings go is based on where we each choose to take ourselves. I also liked his discussion about people's fears of being really behind or really ahead, specifically, "Each person has a ton to offer and a ton to learn, and a ton to learn in offering". I think this recognizes the value that each person can bring to the table - we're all smart, capable and creative people, and when given the trust and opportunity to realize those qualities, each person can flourish.

    <li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
    <p>
    It will be exciting to take my learning into my own hands. I like that we're encouraged to learn both formally from instructors but also informally through personal research, collaboration, and playing around. As a kinesthetic learning, doing is the way that I understand. I learn best when I can go hands-on, try to break things, then learn how to fix it. This culture seems exactly condusive to that - try things out, ask questions, go on tangents that are interesting to you while achieving goals, attempt something new. At the same time, this type of learning culture is different from other learning environments that I have been a part of, so I'm interested to see how my old habits will mesh with this new environment, and what kind of learning experience that will produce for me.
    </p>
    <li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>
    <p>
    I see now that the "creator" culture plays a much more significant role at EDA than I initially expected. I had contemplated whether to take a dev course in Toronto or NZ, and when doing research I very much went according to the "restaurant" mentality of looking at programs based on what's on their menu at what price point. The marketing for all the schools is somewhat similar, so I don't know whether this culture is reflective of dev schools generally or this school in specific. No less, I can see how, since the mentality to programming must be creative and explorative, so too must be a school teaching programming. If anything, Shereef's fireside chat has given me a clearer picture of what dev in general is like. It's only natural, then, that EDA has chosen to follow the mentality and mindframe behind software engineering and integrated it into the entire learning model.
    </p>
    <li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</li>
    <p>
    Yes, and yes! I think this kind of learning environment will be much more engaging - and therefore fun - than I had anticipated. I'm also nervous, though, to meet the bar. I see creativity as its own muscle, something that needs to be practiced. As mentioned in the video, Education is often perceived as something outside of ourselves that just gets fed to us. In turn, standard education systems (and often time, workplaces too) don't encourage creativity and therefore it's often a muscle that's not flexed. So, I'm nervous about using a muscle that I haven't purposefully trained much. Still, it was encouraging to know that we're all coming in at more or less the same knowledge point so that we can learn together rather than compare ourselves.
