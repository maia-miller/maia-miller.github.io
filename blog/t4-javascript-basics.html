          <li> How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</li>
            <p>
              JavaScript is the dynamic language to website building. HTML and CSS are the languages that you use to create the static components of a website - HTML builds the foundations (the text, the order of the information on the screen), while CSS styles that information. JavaScript adds movement to that styling. It allows a person to interact with a website by receiving different output information based on the user's interaction or input.

          <li>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</li>
            <p>
              Control flow and loops are how the computer runs through your information. Typically it reads from top to bottom, executing lines one at a time. When you change the control flow with loops, you tell the computer that after it finishes executing a certain line, instead of moving on to the next line, to loop back up to where the loop started.
            </p>
            <p>
              An everyday example of control flow and looping is your morning routine. Your regular flow in the morning involves turn off the alarm, get up, brush teeth, get dressed. Let's say, though, that you're really tired this morning and you don't get up after your alarm goes off! This is where a loop comes in: (1) Alarm goes off. (2) <em>If</em> you hit snooze and stay in bed, then (or <em>else</em> in coding) the alarm will go off again. This loop will continue until the first "if" ("you hit snooze") is no longer true - that is, it will continue until you stop hitting snooze and you actually get up.

          <li>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</li>
            <p>
              <strong>Arrays</strong> are ordered lists. <strong>Objects</strong> are buckets containing unordered items/keys, usually representing a real-life object with those items/keys being properties of that real-life object. Both arrays and objects start counting from 0 and not 1, so in both cases the first item is #0, then #1, #2, etc. The fourth item would be #3.
            </p>
            <p>Because <strong>arrays</strong> are ordered lists, when you retrieve information from within it, you call upon the item's place in the list. For example, if you want to call the third item, called "hat", in the list, instead of calling for "hat", you call for "the item in position #3". Specifically, it would look like this:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>var myData = myArray[2]</code>
            </p>
            <p>When we modify content within an <strong>array</strong>, because the order matters, you call upon methods, which are based on if you want to add an item at the beginning or end of the list.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data within <strong>objects</strong> can be accessed by <code>dot notation</code> or by <code>bracket notation</code> (unlike arrays, which only uses brackets). Again, the order of the data within an object does not matter, so when we access its data, we call upon it by name:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>console.log(myObject.keyName);</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Likewise, when we modify content within an <strong>object</strong>, we call upon the key's specific name and simply write out what we want that piece of data to now look like. If we want to add new items/keys into the object, we simply write out <code>myObject.newKey = ["the new value"]</code> and the key will be added to the end of the list of keys within the object. The order does not matter.
            </p>
          <li>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</li>
            <p>
              <strong>Functions</strong> take data, perform tasks on that data, then return results. They are a block of code that is executed by simply recalling one phrase. For example, if you often want to add +1 to your data, it can be tedious to continuously write out to add 1 whenever you wanted that to occur.Instead, you would define your function at the beginning (let's say, <code>function plusOne</code>) and write out the formula that would add 1 to a given data. Then, every time you wanted to add 1 to your data, you simply call upon the function plusOne instead of having to write out the full formula each time.
            </p>
            <p>This is the structure of a function:</p>
            <p>
              <code>function thisName (param1, param2) {
                //code block here
              }</code>
            </p>
            <p><code>function</code> declares that we are creating a function. <code>thisName</code> is the name we want to give it - we should aim for something descriptive and intuitive, like <code>plusOne</code> or  <code>pizzaOrder</code>. The two parameters in brackets are a placeholder that describe what we'll want the input (the "argument") to be. You can have multiple parameters or just one. A good example of a parameter is <code>num</code> or <code>topping</code>.
            </p>
            <p>When we want to call upon our function, we say (based on the above example):</p>
            <p>
              <code>thisName(34,"dog");</code>
            </p>
            <p>Instead of having to write out the entire code of what we want to do with "34" and "dog", we simply call the formula/function that we outlined earlier. The computer will then know that when it sees the above call, it will run our two parameters - 34 and dog - through the code that we outlined in our function. Time saved!
            </p>
            <p>Functions are useful for exactly that reason - they save time for developers. Instead of always writing out your formulas (which in theory are longer than myData++), you only write it once and then simply call upon it when you need it. Functions also make code easier to read the code - less text means a quicker scan, and if the functions are appropriately labelled, then a coder can also intuit what the code block is and doesn't have to read through it each time the function is being called.
            </p>
