          <li>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</li>
          <p>
            Getting stuck is certainly frustrating, and I feel particularly worked up when I can't see the smaller steps to resolving the challenge/issue. I feel antsy, feel like a victim because I think the task is unfair ("We never learned that!"), and then eventually lose interest. I need to take some time away, write out the problem and possible solution in regular English, maybe ask for help, before trying my hand at it again.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also think that time - or the lack of it - is a trigger for me. The real course is starting soon, and the countdown is compounded by the fact that it also means I'm moving anyday now. When I first open a waffle task and it simply <em>looks</em> long, I shut down because I'm distressed about being able to do it, and how much time it'll take me (which means less time to spend IRL with friends, hobbies, and preparing for my move).
          </p>
          <li>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</li>
          <p>
            I like the idea of saying "I am experiencing x feeling". It helps to remove oneself from the emotion that's happening and then think more critically about it and what to do about it.
